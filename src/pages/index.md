    The world faces ever more complex and critical challenges. In an era of global interdependence, peoples, nations, and cultures must come together to rise above their common hurdles. “Tianxia (天下) ” is a Chinese term expressing the idea of a universal civilizational order under which life on Earth may flourish. Inspired by this ancient concept, the Tianxia Academy believes in empowering the future leaders and thinkers to contribute towards an equitable and harmonious future.

    The Fellowship aims to cultivate leaders dedicated to improving the long-term future through macro-strategic work. This type of work targets areas that hold great transformative potential on the timescale of decades yet are being neglected by current mainstream efforts.

      - quote: The fellows are a highly intelligent, sociable and engaged group at the start of their careers, and are mainly focused on long-term issues. I think engaging with us helped them get a sense of how people are thinking about some of the key problem areas; the fellowship has also yielded some concrete benefits for Founders Pledge, as one of the fellows has put us in touch with a high profile entrepreneur working on improving science.

      quotes:
      - quote: I was impressed by the Tianxia Fellowship programme, and would support its continuation in the coming years. The fellows who were selected were a promising cohort - from a diverse range of backgrounds, but all explicitly value aligned and very committed to steering their future careers for doing the most good. I was particularly struck by their curiosity and eagerness to learn, and certainly got the impression that the Tianxia fellowship was a pivotal experience for several of them in terms of getting their first dose of thorough exposure to the cause areas, organisations, and general concepts involved in long-term thinking.
