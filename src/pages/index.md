  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

    testimonials:
      - quote: The fellows are a highly intelligent, sociable and engaged group at the
          start of their careers, and are mainly focused on long-term issues. I
          think engaging with us helped them get a sense of how people are
          thinking about some of the key problem areas; the fellowship has also
          yielded some concrete benefits for Founders Pledge, as one of the
          fellows has put us in touch with a high profile entrepreneur working
          on improving science.

    testimonials:
      - quote: I was impressed by the Tianxia Fellowship programme, and would support
          its continuation in the coming years. The fellows who were selected
          were a promising cohort - from a diverse range of backgrounds, but all
          explicitly value aligned and very committed to steering their future
          careers for doing the most good. I was particularly struck by their
          curiosity and eagerness to learn, and certainly got the impression
          that the Tianxia fellowship was a pivotal experience for several of
          them in terms of getting their first dose of thorough exposure to the
          cause areas, organisations, and general concepts involved in long-term
          thinking.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
