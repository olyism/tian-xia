    The world faces ever more complex and critical challenges. In an era of
    global interdependence, peoples, nations, and cultures must come together to
    rise above their common hurdles. “Tianxia (天下) ” is a Chinese term
    expressing the idea of a universal civilizational order under which life on
    Earth may flourish. Inspired by this ancient concept, the Tianxia Academy
    believes in empowering the future leaders and thinkers to contribute towards
    an equitable and harmonious future.


    The Fellowship aims to cultivate leaders dedicated to improving the long-term future through macro-strategic work. This type of work targets areas that hold great transformative potential on the timescale of decades yet are being neglected by current mainstream efforts.

        - quote: The fellows are a highly intelligent, sociable and engaged group at the
            start of their careers, and are mainly focused on long-term issues.
            I think engaging with us helped them get a sense of how people are
            thinking about some of the key problem areas; the fellowship has
            also yielded some concrete benefits for Founders Pledge, as one of
            the fellows has put us in touch with a high profile entrepreneur
            working on improving science.

      quotes:
        - quote: I was impressed by the Tianxia Fellowship programme, and would support
            its continuation in the coming years. The fellows who were selected
            were a promising cohort - from a diverse range of backgrounds, but
            all explicitly value aligned and very committed to steering their
            future careers for doing the most good. I was particularly struck by
            their curiosity and eagerness to learn, and certainly got the
            impression that the Tianxia fellowship was a pivotal experience for
            several of them in terms of getting their first dose of thorough
            exposure to the cause areas, organisations, and general concepts
            involved in long-term thinking.

  title: Fellows' testimonials
  testimonials:
    - quote: The Tianxia fellowship was the most concentrated dose of big thinking,
        new ideas, innovative (and effective) organizations, and amazing people
        that I have encountered in my professional life.
    - quote: This is one of the most impactful learning experiences I’ve had.
    - quote: Being part of this fellowship has truly made me appreciate the value of
        having conversations and exchanging ideas with others that share a
        common goal of trying to improve the world; it's just qualitatively
        better than doing all this yourself. I'm very confident that many of the
        insights and connections I've made over the course of this program would
        have entirely eluded me otherwise.
    - quote: The Tianxia fellowship was invaluable for my personal growth and career
        planning. The programme balanced between learning and discussion with
        key organisations and researchers in such a way that there were always
        rich insights to gain regardless of the individual's degree of
        familiarity with long-term thinking. Throughout the programme, I
        received many questions regarding China that evinced people's deep
        curiosity and enthusiasm for the Tianxia fellowship. Not only was this
        an immensely refreshing and affirming experience but it also helped
        fellows gauge how best to guide future research and bridge understanding
        in the community. For instance, as a direct consequence of conversations
        from one of the fellowship events, I will be working with some of the
        fellows to create a research agenda for China's AI strategy. I also
        hugely benefited from the career guidance received over the course of
        the programme and getting to know more people working in macrostrategy
        cause areas; there were fantastic opportunities to bounce ideas around
        which clarified my aspirations for researching the intersection between
        AI policy and China. Perhaps most importantly, it was an honour to
        undertake the programme with and learn from a group of such inspiring
        individuals, whom I now consider among my greatest friends.
    - quote: Solidly the best group experience I have ever had, not even close
    - quote: 我非常推荐你申请”天下学者计划“。如果你真正关注人类未来潜力的实现，具备在长远时间尺度、星球尺度上设想人类未来的视野，关注颠覆性技术（人工智能、生物技术等等）可能会对包括人类在内的地球生命带来的生存性风险，并可以将个人的行动和职业生涯规划与之相结合，这个学者计划将是一次非常难得的机会。
    - quote: You will meet people who can help you resolve uncertainties of the
        trade-offs between making the most good for the long-term future and
        caring unavoidably for the current sufferings.
    - quote: If you are interested in China and care about humanity's long-term
        future, the Tianxia Fellowship is THE fellowship for you. Everyone that
        I met through the fellowship is ambitious, hard-working, and above all,
        dedicated to solving the biggest challenges facing the world today. The
        Fellowship opens up so many opportunities for collaboration, discussion,
        and can even help you launch a new career! I joined the Tianxia
        Fellowship around the time when I was admitted into a PhD program and
        the Fellowship fundamentally shaped my research interests.

    - quote: Tianxia Fellowship exceeded my expectations in all regards. I was able to
        connect with experts and professionals from leading research
        organizations in the Bay Area and was truly inspired by the vision and
        dedication of our speakers, peers, and organizers. I came out of the
        program with valuable knowledge, skill sets, and connections that would
        help me explore some of the most important and urgent issues that
        humanity faces. I highly recommend Tianxia Fellowship and encourage all
        curious minds to apply!

    - quote: The Tianxia Fellowship has been one of the most important experiences in
        my professional life. Being part of the fellowship really provided an
        inspiration for me to learn how the brightest minds devoted themselves
        into improving the world. I truly appreciate this opportunity to embark
        on a journey of thinking big and learning big with a group of
        goal-aligned fellows.

    - quote: "To me, of the 3 main parts of the program: reading preparations,
        partners (organizations we had the chance to speak with), and people
        (fellow participants), each part in itself is already easily one of the
        best experiences I have had. And combined together, just makes for an
        invaluable experience. The readings are highly informative,
        conversations with partners / speakers condense what would take years to
        learn into weeks, and the fellow participants are motivating and
        amazing. It's just awesome, really worth the time."
      author: Osmond
    - quote: The fellowship was a fantastic way for me to deepen my understanding of
        important issues affecting global coordination and possible solutions
        for addressing them. The regular online sessions and reading assignments
        greatly accelerated my learning, and the calibre of scholars and
        industry professionals we were able to exchange ideas with was highly
        impressive. Last but not least, I was able to build strong connections
        with a network of engaged and passionate fellows from diverse
        backgrounds.
