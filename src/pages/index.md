  title: About us
  content: >-
    The world faces ever more complex and critical challenges. In an era of
    global interdependence, peoples, nations, and cultures must come together to
    rise above their common hurdles. “Tianxia (天下) ” is a Chinese term
    expressing the idea of a universal civilizational order under which life on
    Earth may flourish. Inspired by this ancient concept, the Tianxia Academy
    believes in empowering the future leaders and thinkers to contribute towards
    an equitable and harmonious future. 


    The Fellowship aims to cultivate leaders dedicated to improving the long-term future through macro-strategic work. This type of work targets areas that hold great transformative potential on the timescale of decades yet are being neglected by current mainstream efforts.

    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
